## Outlines 

+ Preprocessing of HLA data

  + APC dataset, Mono-> Macrophage 

    > https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-11814

  + H5ad, 

+ Neighbor Graph Trimming

  > For *Subgraph Classification*. 

  + Given any dataset $X\in \R^{n_c \times n_g}$, we try to construct a reweighted graph $G=(V,E)$ where each $v_i\in V$ denotes $x_i\in X$
  + Different from neighboring graph, we distribute weights based on some metric between $V$ 

  >  Ensemble
  
  + Ensemble of graph. 
  > TI(Stain Sequencing), Clustering 
  
  > Other downstream analysis.
